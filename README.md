# Grant Howard

## Biography

Hi ðŸ‘‹ my name is Grant Howard and I am a computer science major here at Eastern Washington University.
When I am not in university, I tend to focus a lot of my time on music.
I am currently a bass player for a band called Rice, and we have been together for 7 years.
In order to promote the band, I build a basic single page website for promoting our music, shows, and ourselves.
This has lead me down the road to Front-end development and even now I am still eager to learn more about what the field has to offer.
